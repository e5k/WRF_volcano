# WRF-Volcano tutorial 

This page is written by Alex Poulidis (Bremen Universität) and Sébastien Biass (Université de Genève) and is designed to provide a hands-on approach to running WRF for applications in volcanology. Feel free to use any of the material for research or education purposes, but we would be grateful if you could contribute back with any new material.
